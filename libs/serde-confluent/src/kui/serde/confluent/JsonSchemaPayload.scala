/** JSON Schema payloads: the bytes are JSON, and the schema decides whether they are *allowed*.
  *
  * The asymmetry between the two directions is deliberate and is the whole content of this file.
  *
  *   - **Reading** does not validate. A record that is already in the topic is there whether or not it
  *     matches its schema, and a viewer that refused to show it would hide the one record an operator opened
  *     the screen to investigate — which is very often the malformed one. So decoding strips the five-byte
  *     header and returns the JSON.
  *   - **Writing** validates, and refuses. Producing a record KUI could not read back would put bytes in a
  *     topic that outlive the mistake, and the schema is right there.
  *
  * ==On the two `SchemaRegistry` types==
  *
  * `com.networknt.schema.SchemaRegistry` is this library's *local* schema store — a factory that turns schema
  * text into a validator — and has nothing to do with `kui.serde.confluent.SchemaRegistry`, which is the
  * Confluent registry over HTTP. The import renames it so that no reader of this file has to hold both
  * meanings of the word at once.
  *
  * The library validates straight from a `String`, so KUI never constructs a Jackson tree and this module
  * needs no Jackson dependency of its own. Well-formedness is checked with circe, which the module already
  * has, and which produces the same judgement.
