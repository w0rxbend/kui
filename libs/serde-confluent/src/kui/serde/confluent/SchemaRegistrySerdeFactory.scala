/** The `SerdeFactory` seam of `libs/serde`, filled in.
  *
  * `ClusterSerdes.SerdeFactory` returns `Resource[F, Either[String, Serde[F]]]`, and that signature is the
  * entire contract this file has to honour. A registry that is unreachable when a cluster is built must not
  * stop the cluster being built: it must produce a `Left` carrying a sentence, so that `ClusterSerdes` shows
  * the picker a disabled `SchemaRegistry` row explaining itself (ADR-032), and so that asking for the serde
  * by name returns `KUI-SERDE-UNAVAILABLE` rather than silently falling through to `Fallback`.
  *
  * ==Why the probe==
  *
  * `create` does not merely build a client; it asks the registry one question and waits for the answer. That
  * is what turns "configured" into "working", and it is the difference between a picker that tells an
  * operator their registry URL has a typo in it and one that looks fine until the first record fails to
  * decode. The cost is one HTTP call per cluster per profile version, bounded by the upstream's own timeout.
  *
  * ==What the probe asks==
  *
  * The latest version of a subject that is not expected to exist. A registry that is up answers 404, which is
  * a successful call; a registry that is down, misconfigured or rejecting KUI's credentials fails, and the
  * failure is what the disabled row shows. Asking for something absent rather than listing every subject is
  * deliberate: a registry with forty thousand subjects should not be made to enumerate them so that KUI can
  * find out it is awake.
