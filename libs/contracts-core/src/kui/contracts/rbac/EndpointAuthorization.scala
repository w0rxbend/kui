/** What an endpoint declares it needs permission for, attached to the endpoint itself.
  *
  * ==Why this lives on the endpoint and not in a table==
  *
  * The gateway must refuse a call before it leaves the edge, and the service behind it must refuse the same
  * call again, because a service that trusts its caller is a service that is open to anyone who reaches it
  * directly. Two enforcement points need the same rule. A lookup table on either side would be a second
  * spelling of that rule, and the one thing this project has learned the hard way is that a rule written
  * twice is a rule that disagrees with itself — usually in the direction of allowing something.
  *
  * So the rule is written once, by the team that owns the contract, on the endpoint. The gateway reads it off
  * the published `AnyEndpoint` it is already proxying; the service reads it off the very same value when it
  * binds its route. Neither can drift, because there is nothing to drift from.
  *
  * ==Why it is a declaration and not a function==
  *
  * A `Principal => Boolean` on the endpoint would be more flexible and could not be inspected. This shape can
  * be enumerated: `EndpointAuthorizationSuite` in each contract module walks every endpoint the service
  * publishes and fails if one carries no declaration. An endpoint added next year without a permission is a
  * build failure rather than a hole nobody notices, which is exactly the treatment `KuiEndpoint.MutationKey`
  * already gets for mutations.
  *
  * @param operation
  *   the stable operation name for the audit record and the log line. It matches the endpoint's own
  *   `.name(...)` so that "who was refused what" and "which route" are one string, not two
  * @param requirements
  *   every resource the call touches. All of them must be permitted: an operation that reads one topic and
  *   writes another is refused unless both are allowed, and it is refused before either happens
