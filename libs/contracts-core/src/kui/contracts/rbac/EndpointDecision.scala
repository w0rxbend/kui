  * ==Why it is here and not at each enforcement point==
  *
  * Three places have to answer it and they must never disagree: the gateway, before the call leaves the edge;
  * the service, because a service that trusts its caller is open to anyone who can reach it directly; and the
  * browser, so a control the server would refuse is never drawn as a button. This file compiles for the JVM
  * and for Scala.js and all three call [[decide]].
  *
  * ==What the browser's copy is worth==
  *
  * Nothing, as a security measure, and that is fine — its job is to hide a control, not to protect anything.
  * The two server-side calls are the enforcement, and the second one is not redundant with the first.

    * `Left` means the question could not be formed at all — the endpoint carries no declaration, or names its
    * resource with a path parameter that this request's path does not have. It is deliberately not folded
    * into `Denied`: a denial is a fact about the caller and belongs in the audit trail as one, while this is
    * a fact about the code, belongs in the log at error level, and should wake somebody. Both refuse the
    * request; only one of them is a bug.

  /** The coarse half of the check for a resource whose name is only in the request body.
    *
    * `Rbac.decide` above has already applied the cluster gate, and the read-only gate over every requirement
    * whose name this side of the hop can see. What it could not consider is a requirement named
    * [[NameSource.RequestBody]] — a topic create names its topic in the body — so those are handled here, and
    * exactly two things are asserted about them:
    *
    *   1. **read-only still refuses.** A create on a read-only cluster is refused at the edge, which is the
    *      whole point of the flag and does not depend on knowing the name.
    *   1. **the principal holds the action on *some* pattern of that resource.** Somebody with no topic
    *      permissions at all cannot reach the create endpoint. Somebody whose grant is `payments\..*` can,
    *      and if they then ask to create `orders` the service refuses them with the name in hand.
    *
    * This is stated as a deliberate weakening rather than hidden as an implementation detail, because a
    * reader has to be able to see where the exact check lives. The alternative — the gateway decoding every
    * service's request bodies to authorize them — would put a copy of eleven services' DTOs in the one module
    * that is supposed to know none of them.
