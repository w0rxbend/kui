/** [[MaskingEngine.maskPayload]]: the entry point a service calls, and the two choices it makes for it.
  *
  * It exists because `services/message` holds a `Decoded(text, kind, …)` and no circe — ADR-041 rule A3
  * forbids its use cases JSON — so the choice between [[MaskingEngine.maskJson]] and
  * [[MaskingEngine.maskText]] has to be made inside this module or be made twice outside it. Both of the
  * choices below are ones a caller would plausibly make differently, which is why each has a case.
