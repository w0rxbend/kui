/** The masking rules, applied. Pure functions over `Json` and `String`, with no effect and no failure path.
  *
  * Every function here is total and the identity is a legal result, which is why none of them returns an
  * `Either`. The one dangerous case — a rule that matches nothing because of a typo — cannot be caught here
  * at all; it is caught at startup, where an unusable regex is a configuration error
  * (`kui.clusters[].masking[]`, `MaskingConfig`). `docs/operations/masking.md` is the operator's guide to
  * writing one; it exists as of wave 10, and the sentence that stood here for nine waves — saying the file
  * had never existed — is what it replaces.
  *
  * ## The application order
  *
  * A **JSON** value gets **every** matching rule, in configuration order. Two rules on the same field
  * compose, which is what lets an operator write "replace this field" and "mask everything else" and get
  * both.
  *
  * A **non-JSON** value gets the **first** matching rule's string form only. There is no meaningful way to
  * compose "remove" and "keep the last four characters" over a payload with no structure, and applying rules
  * in sequence to flat text produces results that depend on rule order in ways nobody can predict from
  * reading the configuration.
  *
  * This is Kafbat's order, kept so that a migrating operator's policies behave the way their old tool
  * behaved.
  *
  * ## Where it runs
  *
  * After deserialization and before any DTO leaves the service, including `originalValue` (ADR-023). This
  * object does not decide that — the browse use case does — but the placement is the entire point: a masked
  * field that is still readable in one response shape is not masked.

  /** One decoded payload's text, masked, whichever of the two forms the serde said it is in.
    *
    * This is the entry point a *service* calls, and it exists so that a caller does not have to hold circe in
    * order to mask a record. `services/message` sees a `Decoded(text, kind, …)` and nothing else; making it
    * parse the text itself would put the parse, the fallback below and the re-serialisation in a layer that
    * ADR-041 rule A3 forbids JSON to, and would put a second copy of the choice between [[maskJson]] and
    * [[maskText]] next to every caller.
    *
    * ==Why the kind decides, and not a parse attempt==
    *
    * Trying `parse` first and treating anything that succeeds as JSON is wrong for a payload the serde
    * already called text: `42` and `true` are valid JSON documents, so a plain-text topic whose records
    * happen to be numbers would take the document path, and a whole-value rule would then render `42` as
    * `"**"` — quotes and all — where the text path renders `**`. The serde has already decided what it
    * produced; re-deciding here is how two layers come to disagree about the same record.
    *
    * ==The fallback, which is the part that matters==
    *
    * A payload labelled JSON that will not parse still gets the **text** form rather than being returned
    * untouched. That case is reachable — a serde reporting a kind it did not verify, a truncated document —
    * and the alternative is publishing in full the field the rule exists to hide, which is the one outcome
    * masking may never have. Masking too much is recoverable; masking nothing is not.
