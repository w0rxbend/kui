  * That is what makes a successful write mean the writer has read its own record from the log rather than
  * hopefully mutated a local map — and it needs one small piece of machinery, which is this.
  *
  * It lives in its own file so that the timing rule is specified rather than hoped for: every case below is
  * tested with `TestControl` and no broker, including the one that would otherwise show up as an intermittent
  * timeout in production once a month.
