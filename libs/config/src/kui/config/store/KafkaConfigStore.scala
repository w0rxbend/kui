/** The Kafka-backed `ConfigStore`: replay the whole log, then follow its tail forever.

  * Acquiring this `Resource` **is** the bootstrap step of ADR-042 §1. A caller holding the value knows which
  * clusters exist, because nothing is handed out until replay has reached the end of the log. That ordering
  * is what lets a service gate its readiness on this resource and never report itself Ready with an empty
  * registry — "you have no clusters" and "your clusters were deleted" look identical to a user.
  *
  * The other thing this file is shaped by is the worst startup failure a service can have, which is a hang.
  * Replay takes the end offset once, before it consumes anything, so it is never chasing a moving target; and
  * the whole of it runs under a timeout that fails with `KUI-STORE-REPLAY-TIMEOUT` naming how far it got,
  * where it was going, and how long it took.
