    * A *stale* version is a writer that lost a race: two replicas both read version 2, both produced version
    * 3, and the one whose record landed second in the partition lost. A *future* version is a gap, which
    * means records were lost or the log was edited by hand — and accepting it would let a writer skip the
    * conflict check entirely by inventing a large version number.
    *
    * Every replica applies this rule to the same ordered log, so every replica agrees on who won without any
    * of them talking to each other. That is what makes "the partition, not a lock, is the serialization
    * point" (ADR-042 §3) true rather than aspirational — and it is why the version rule, not the pre-write
    * check, is the correctness guarantee.
