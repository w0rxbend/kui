/** That a writer parks until its own record comes back around the log, and is always woken — by the
  * record arriving, by the timeout, or by the follower dying.
  *
  * The one that earns this file its existence is `awaitCompletesImmediatelyWhenTheOffsetIsAlreadyPast`.
  * The follower can win the race against the writer that produced the record, and a waiter that checked
  * "has it arrived?" outside the same atomic step that registers it would park for ever against a record
  * that has already gone by. That bug does not fail a happy-path test; it fails in production, once a
  * month, as an unexplained write timeout.
