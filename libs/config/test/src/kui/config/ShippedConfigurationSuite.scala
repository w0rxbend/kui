/** That every configuration file this repository ships actually loads.
  *
  * The file that prompted this suite is `deployment/quickstart/kui-quickstart.yaml`. It carried a cluster
  * written with invented field names for months, and nothing noticed, because the loader tolerated anything
  * under `kui.clusters` and no test ever read the file. The quickstart is the first thing a newcomer runs; a
  * broken example there is worse than no example.
  *
  * The rule this enforces is narrow and worth stating: a configuration file committed to this repository is
  * an example somebody will copy, so it has to be one the shipped loader accepts. Nothing here asserts what
  * the values *mean* — that is each file's own business — only that KUI would start with them.
