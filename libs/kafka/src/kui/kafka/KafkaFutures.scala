/** The bridge from Kafka's own future to a cats-effect one.
  *
  * Two things go wrong if this is written at a call site, and both are recorded in
  * `research/kafka/admin-capabilities.md` §0.
  *
  * A `KafkaFuture` completes exceptionally with a `CompletionException` or an `ExecutionException` wrapping
  * the error that matters. Code that matches on the thrown type therefore matches the wrapper, misses every
  * specific case, and falls through to a generic branch — which is how "you are not authorized for that
  * topic" becomes "something went wrong".
  *
  * And every completion callback runs on the admin client's single network thread. Anything KUI does there —
  * a metric, a log line, a `flatMap` that happens to block — stalls every other in-flight request on that
  * connection until `request.timeout.ms` fires.

    * request holding a slot on that single thread.
