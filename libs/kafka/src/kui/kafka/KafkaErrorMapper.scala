/** Everything a Kafka client can throw, turned into an error KUI can act on.
  *
  * Three separate decisions key on this file, which is why it is a first-mover rather than a detail:
  *
  *   - **Whether a failure dims a capability.** ADR-039 §6 reports only `InfrastructureError` to the
  *     capability registry. Classify "you lack an ACL for this topic" as infrastructure and one user's
  *     missing permission greys the feature out for everybody.
  *   - **What HTTP status the user gets.** `ErrorCode` decides it through `ErrorEnvelope.statusOf`, so a
  *     wrong row here is a 500 where a 403 belonged.
  *   - **Whether the connection is thrown away.** That was decided in KAFKA-004, and `classify` calls
  *     `AdminInvalidation.isReconnectClass` rather than restating the list, so the two cannot drift.
  *
  * Nothing here throws, ever. It is the last thing between a Java SDK and an HTTP response, and a mapper that
  * can fail turns a handled error into a 500.
