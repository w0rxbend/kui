/** Every failure KUI returns, as a value.

  * Business code returns `F[Either[KuiError, A]]` and never throws: an exception that crosses a layer
  * boundary carries a stack trace, a class name and often an upstream response body, none of which belong in
  * an HTTP response, and all of which end up there by accident the first time nobody catches it. Adapters
  * translate the exceptions their libraries throw into these cases at the boundary (ADR-034); genuinely fatal
  * errors still propagate.
  *
  * The three branches say where a failure came from, which is what decides who can fix it:
  *
  *   - [[DomainError]] — a business rule was broken. The request was understood and refused.
  *   - [[ApplicationError]] — the use case cannot proceed: the thing is missing, the caller is not allowed,
  *     the state is wrong.
  *   - [[InfrastructureError]] — something KUI depends on failed. The user did nothing wrong.
  *
  * **`message` is display text.** It must never contain a stack trace, an upstream response body, a JAAS
  * configuration string, a URL with credentials, or the contents of a `Secret`. That is why
  * `InfrastructureError.Upstream` carries a status code and no body: a field that does not exist cannot be
  * logged by mistake.
