/** A record, as a filter sees it.
  *
  * Deliberately neither the wire DTO nor `libs/kafka`'s `RawRecord`. Taking the DTO would make the browse
  * pipeline serialise before it filters; taking `RawRecord` would make a filter run on undecoded bytes and
  * would put a Kafka dependency on this module. This is the decoded middle, which is the only place a
  * predicate over `record.value.status` can be evaluated at all.
  *
  * Everything is already a `String` because that is what a serde produces (`DeserializeResult.text`). Where a
  * value happens to be JSON, the CEL environment additionally exposes it parsed, so both
  * `record.valueAsText.contains('x')` and `record.value.status == 'FAILED'` work on the same record.

  * and the error is counted — excluded rather than included, because a filter is a narrowing and a user who
  * asked for failures does not want successes when the predicate breaks. The count reaches the screen
  * (`consumed.filterErrors`), so a filter that fails on every record is visible rather than silent.
