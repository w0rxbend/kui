/** The identity of a filter: `sha256(source)`, first 16 hexadecimal characters.

  * is meaningless to every other one, and a filter registered before a rolling restart stops existing. A
  * content hash means every replica independently agrees on the id of the same source, registering the same
  * filter twice is free, and a load balancer is allowed to do its job.
  *
  * Sixteen hex characters is 64 bits. A collision needs about four billion distinct filters in one cache of
  * ten thousand entries, and the consequence of one would be a user's filter evaluating as somebody else's —
  * which is why the source is re-sent alongside the id (`filterSource`, ADR-017) and a cache entry is only
