  * is a network call. For a serde that turns four bytes into an integer, all eight collapse into two pure
  * functions, and writing them out nine times would be nine chances to get `canSerialize` subtly wrong in one
  * of them.
  *
  * Subclasses provide [[decode]] and [[encode]]; everything else has a default that is right for a pure
  * codec. A serde that genuinely differs — one that is read-only, say — overrides the one method it differs
  * in.
