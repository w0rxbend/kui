/** JSON, and only JSON that is an object or an array.
  *
  * A bare `123` and a bare `"hello"` are both valid JSON documents, and neither is what a user means when
  * they say a topic is a JSON topic. Accepting them would make this serde claim every number payload and
  * every quoted string, and — more damagingly — mark them `PayloadKind.Json`, which is what the table view
  * uses to decide it can flatten a record into columns. A table view offered a column layout for a payload of
  * `123` is a table view with one nameless column.
  *
  * The text KUI sends is **compact**, not pretty-printed. Pretty-printing on the server multiplies the bytes
  * on the wire by roughly three for no gain: the browser re-formats for display anyway (MSG-036), and it is
  * the browser that knows how wide the window is.

    *   - text that starts correctly and breaks somewhere inside, where the actionable advice is the short
    *     list of things that are actually wrong with hand-typed JSON, plus the position to look at.
