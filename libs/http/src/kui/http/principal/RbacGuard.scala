/** A service's own permission check, run on every route it serves.
  *
  * ==Why a second check==
  *
  * The gateway already refused this call if the caller had no permission for it, and that check is the one
  * that saves the work. This one is the one that is load-bearing. A KUI service listens on its own port, in
  * its own container, and anything that can reach that port and mint a principal the service will verify can
  * call it — the gateway is not a wall, it is a door. ADR-021 says every service re-runs the decision from
  * the signed principal for exactly that reason, and a service that skips it is open to whatever else shares
  * its network.
  *
  * It is not a copy of the gateway's rule. Both call `EndpointDecision.decide` over the same declaration the
  * endpoint carries, so there is one rule with two enforcement points, which is the only arrangement in which
  * they cannot disagree.
  *
  * ==What it can check that the gateway cannot==
  *
  * The cluster's name and the resource's name, from the same path — and, in due course, the names that are
  * only in the request body, which the gateway does not decode. `SecuredRoutes.withBody` has the decoded
  * input in hand and is where that check belongs; it is not implemented here yet, and the endpoints in that
  * position are enumerated by the gateway's `EndpointAuthorizationSuite` rather than left to be discovered.
