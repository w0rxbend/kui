/** Binding a `/internal/v1` endpoint to the code behind it, with the gateway's signature checked first.
  *
  * ==Why this is one class in `libs/http` and not one per service==
  *
  * Every service's `api` module does the same four things to every endpoint it publishes: read the request
  * line and the correlation id off the request, verify the signed principal against them (ADR-020), decide
  * the HTTP status from the failure with `ErrorEnvelope.statusOf` (ADR-034), and render the envelope. Written
  * per service, those four things are four copies of an authentication check, and rule A11 forbids one
  * service from seeing another's `api` module — so the copies could not even be compared, only re-derived.
  * `PrincipalInterceptor` next door was hoisted here for exactly that reason, and this is the other half of
  * the same job.
  *
  * ==The bodied case (ADR-020 Amendment 1)==
  *
  * [[apply]] verifies in Tapir's *security* stage, which runs before the request body is decoded: an
  * unauthenticated caller is refused without this service parsing a byte of what they sent.
  *
  * That is not possible for an endpoint that carries a body. ADR-020 binds a token to one call by hashing the
  * method, the path **and the body**; the gateway signs the bytes it is about to send, so a service that
  * hashed only the request line would refuse every bodied call as `request_mismatch` — which is exactly what
  * happened the first time the offset-reset wizard ran against a real cluster. Tapir gives the security stage
  * a `ServerRequest`, and a `ServerRequest` does not expose the raw bytes; there is no `extractFromRequest`
  * that can read them.
  *
  * So [[withBody]] verifies one stage later, inside the endpoint's own logic, where the decoded input is in
  * hand, and reconstructs the signed bytes by re-encoding that input with the very codec the gateway encoded
  * it with. The reconstruction is exact rather than approximate: the gateway does not forward a caller's
  * bytes, it re-encodes the decoded value through this same contract (`SttpServiceClient`), and both sides
  * print with circe's `Printer.noSpaces` over a hand-written field order (ADR-007). [[bodyBytes]] is that
  * printer, and it is shared for the same reason this class is — two printers is two hashes.
  *
  * The cost is stated plainly: the body of an unauthenticated request is decoded before the token is checked.
  * It is bounded — a few hundred bytes of JSON through a codec that refuses anything it does not recognise —
  * and it buys back the binding that stops a token minted for one call from being replayed with a different
  * body, which is the property that actually matters on a mutating endpoint.
  *
  * @param service
  *   this service's id, which is the `aud` claim a token must have been minted for. A token for `topic` is
  *   refused by `message`, and that is the check this parameter exists for.
