/** The guard itself, constructed — which nothing in this repository did before.
  *
  * ==Why a suite here and not only in a service==
  *
  * `services/cluster/api`'s `ServiceRbacGuardSuite` drives real routes through a real server and is the
  * better test of the *seam*. What it cannot reach is the branch that fires when the question cannot be
  * formed at all: every endpoint a KUI service publishes carries a declaration, because each contract module
  * has a suite that fails the build if one does not. So `EndpointDecision.decide` never answers `Left` in
  * that suite, and `RbacGuard.fromPolicy`'s fail-closed branch was executed by nothing in the repository —
  * made to return `().asRight`, `./mill services.cluster.api.test` stayed at 752/752.
  *
  * An endpoint with no declaration is exactly what this file constructs, and it is not a contrived shape: it
  * is what a route added next year without one looks like from inside the guard. The rule the branch keeps is
  * the one `EndpointAuthorization.accessRequest`'s own scaladoc states — *"answering 'allowed' because the
  * question could not be formed is how authorization bypasses happen"* — and this is where it is asserted.
