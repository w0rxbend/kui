/**
 * The group page's destructive controls: who is offered them, what they ask before they run, and
 * the toast each success owes the operator.
 *
 * ## What was added in wave 6, and why it is in this file
 *
 * The file began as the two toasts and grew the forget control's receipt. What it never had was the
 * half **above** the receipt: whether the control is offered at all. `GroupDetail` renders each of
 * the three disabled-with-a-reason when it is handed no callback, and `consumers.test.tsx` covers
 * that rendering — but the three ternaries that decide which it is handed are here, in the route,
 * and the harness could only mount the route with a `permits` that said yes. All three were
 * therefore constants that no case in the repository could observe, and the worst of them handed an
 * account with no reset permission a live destructive button. `testContext` takes a `permits` now,
 * for exactly that.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists rather than another case in `consumers.test.tsx`
 *
 * "A toast on every destructive success" is one of M6's bullets, and until this file both of
 * `GroupRoute`'s `notify(…)` calls could be deleted with all 68 of this package's tests still
 * green. Nothing mounted the route: the list screen has a suite, the wizard has one, the detail
 * page has one, and the file that joins them to a client — the only place a mutation's *result* is
 * observed — had none. So the rule was written down twice, in two comments arguing for it, and
 * asserted nowhere.
 *
 * The seam is therefore the route with a router around it and a recording underneath, and the
 * assertion is on `toasts()`, the kernel's own store, which is what `ToastRegion` draws from in the
 * shell. Asserting against markup this package renders would prove nothing: this package renders no
 * toast, and a case that mounted `ToastRegion` beside the route would be asserting that the kernel
 * can draw a toast it was handed.
 *
 * ## Why the detail answer is the recorded document, edited
 *
 * `recorded/group.json` came off a running gateway, so the shape the mapping reads is the shape a
 * coordinator sends. The two cases below need states the quickstart cannot be put into — a group
 * with no members, because a group with members cannot be deleted and the button says so before the
 * click — so the recording is copied and the one field under test is changed. Everything else,
 * including every field name, stays the server's.
