/**
 * Mounting and axe, for the consumer screens' tests.
 *
 * The same eight lines as `packages/kernel/src/components/testing.ts` and
 * `packages/shell/src/chrome/testing.ts`. It is copied a third time rather than shared because a
 * feature must not depend on another feature and the kernel's copy is not exported from
 * `@kui/kernel` — deliberately, since a test helper in a product bundle is dead weight the browser
 * downloads. The kernel's copy carries the full reasoning; the two rules are repeated here because
 * they are the ones a Solid 2 test fails on:
 *
 * - `flush()` before asserting. A setter queues and the DOM catches up on the next microtask, so a
 *   test that asserts immediately reads the previous value and fails as though the component were
 *   broken.
 * - Dispose at the end. Reactive primitives need an owner; leaving one alive leaks listeners
 *   between cases, and the symptom is a later test failing because of an earlier one.
 *
 * If a fourth copy is ever wanted, that is the moment to make a `@kui/testing` package.
