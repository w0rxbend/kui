/**
 * The consumer screens' tests.
 *
 * Two kinds, deliberately separated. The pure ones exercise the rules — which chip a state gets,
 * when lag turns amber, what sentence the voice picks, whether the form refuses — and need no DOM.
 * The rendered ones exercise the things that are only true once markup exists: that an unreadable
 * lag draws an em dash rather than a zero, that a narrow window drops a column instead of hiding
 * it, and that pressing Preview always changes the screen.
 *
 * Everything a Solid 2 test has to remember is in `testing.ts`: `flush()` before asserting, and
 * dispose at the end.
