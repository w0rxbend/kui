/**
 * The consumer feature's route entry: the screen the shell renders for every `/consumer-groups…`
 * address.
 *
 *   /clusters/:clusterId/consumer-groups            the list
 *   /clusters/:clusterId/consumer-groups/:groupId   one group
 *
 * It used to render `SAMPLE_GROUPS` — a screen that looked like it worked and showed invented
 * groups with invented lag. That is the most dangerous state this product can be in: an operator
 * checking whether a consumer is behind would have got a confident answer about a group that does
 * not exist.
 *
 * ## Paging, and the count that is not the array's length
 *
 * The list is one page of the cluster's groups. The page number is this screen's state and it is
 * part of the query key, so asking for page 2 is a different request rather than the same request
 * re-read; `GroupList` gets the server's `totalItems` and prints that over the table. Nothing here
 * derives a total from `rows`.
 *
 * ## `useQuery` rather than the fourth hand-rolled fetch hook
 *
 * The copy that used to live here started every attempt at `loading`, so a poll that failed blanked
 * a table of real figures. `useQuery` keeps the last good answer and marks it stale, which is
 * ADR-032's rule, and it shares one request per key with anything else asking for the same page.
 * (The name of the hook it replaced is deliberately not written here: M6's exit criterion greps
 * this tree for it, and a comment naming it would keep a closed migration looking open.)
