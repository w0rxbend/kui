/**
 * The consumer-group list — screenshot `04`.
 *
 * Six columns, and six is the whole list: GROUP ID, STATE, MEMBERS, TOPICS, COORDINATOR, LAG.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately not here, and why that is the point
 *
 * The Laminar screen this replaces drew eight columns. Two of them — PARTITIONS and PACE — are gone.
 * PACE is gone because the design does not draw it; PARTITIONS is gone because it was one of several
 * columns that showed an em dash on every row of every cluster the team ever looked at. The brief
 * for this work names the rule: a column that can never be filled teaches people to stop reading
 * columns, so either fill it or leave it out.
 *
 * That is a real loss and it is worth naming. Lag on its own does not answer the operator's actual
 * question, which is "is this getting better?" — a lag of two million falling at forty thousand a
 * second needs nothing, and a lag of nine hundred that is not moving needs attention now. The
 * answer is not to smuggle PACE back into a table the design does not draw it in; it is on the group
 * detail page, where there is room to print it with the word "per second" beside it.
 *
 * ## The row is a link, and it is also a row
 *
 * Every row carries a real `<a href>` in its first cell, because copy-link, bookmark and
 * open-in-new-tab are three gestures a table of names has to support, and none of them survives a
 * `div` with an `onClick`. The row itself is *also* activatable, so the hit target is the whole
 * width — `DataTable` handles the keyboard for that. A modified click (⌘, Ctrl, Shift, Alt) is left
 * alone: it is the user asking their browser for a new tab, and swallowing it breaks the one gesture
 * that makes a table of links worth having.
 *
 * ## The narrow window drops columns rather than hiding them
 *
 * SPEC §7.5: below 900px, COORDINATOR goes first and TOPICS second, and GROUP ID, STATE and LAG
 * never go. They are dropped from the array, not set to `display: none`, because a hidden column is
 * still in the accessibility tree and still counted in the row — a screen-reader user would hear a
 * cell nobody can see.
