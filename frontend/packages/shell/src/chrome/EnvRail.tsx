/**
 * The 48px column to the left of the drawer: the product mark, one tile per environment, a stack of
 * shortcut glyphs, and the account.
 *
 * ## What it is, and what it is not
 *
 * It is not a second drawer. It has no fill of its own — it is drawn straight on the page ground,
 * which is why it has no edge (`research/design/SCREENS.md` §1.1, sampled at row 700 of
 * `13-topics-list.png`: the first 48 pixels are `--kui-color-surface`, and the drawer's
 * `--kui-color-surface-raised` only starts at x=48).
 *
 * It exists because switching environment used to be a dropdown in the top bar, and a dropdown
 * hides the one fact an operator most needs to have in peripheral vision: **which cluster am I
 * about to break?** A column of always-visible tiles answers that without being asked, and it makes
 * "production" and "staging" two different places on the screen rather than two lines of the same
 * menu.
 *
 * ## The letter is not an identifier
 *
 * A tile shows the environment's initial. Two environments beginning with the same letter therefore
 * produce two identical tiles — `prod-kyiv-01` and `prod-eu-02` are both `P` — and the design has no
 * answer for that yet (`SCREENS.md` §6, open finding 1).
 *
 * Until it does, the rule this component enforces is: **the rail is never the only place an
 * environment is named.** Every tile has a tooltip carrying the full name, the tooltip is not
 * optional, and the drawer's head below states the current environment in words. If you are tempted
 * to remove the tooltip because the tiles "look cleaner", read this paragraph again — the tiles are
 * ambiguous by construction and the tooltip is what makes them safe.
 *
 * ## Health is on the tile and in words elsewhere
 *
 * The dot on a tile's corner mirrors that environment's health, and it is decorative: colour is
 * never the only signal, so the authoritative statement is the drawer's head and the tooltip, both
 * of which say it in words. The dot's fourth state matters as much as the other three — an
 * environment whose health is not yet known takes `--kui-color-text-subtle`, which is not any of
 * the health colours, so "we have not asked" can never be read as "it is fine".
