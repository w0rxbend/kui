/**
 * The band across the top of the content column: where you are, what you are looking for, and the
 * controls that are not about any one page.
 *
 * ## It is a band, not a bar
 *
 * It has no fill. Scanning column 1000 of `13-topics-list.png` from the top returns the page ground
 * the whole way down (`SCREENS.md` §1.1): what used to be a 58px bar with its own surface is now
 * 58px of page with three things floating in it — the breadcrumb, the search pill, and the control
 * cluster. The height is unchanged, so nothing below it moves.
 *
 * ## What left, and where it went
 *
 * The cluster selector is gone from here. It is the environment rail now, and for a reason worth
 * stating: a dropdown answers "which cluster am I on?" only when it is asked, and that is the one
 * question an operator should never have to ask. The account avatar moved to the rail's foot with
 * it, so that identity and environment — the two things that decide what a destructive action will
 * actually destroy — sit together.
 *
 * ## Three theme states, not two
 *
 * The theme control cycles auto → light → dark and shows which one is in force. Two states would be
 * simpler and would be wrong: an operator on "follow the system" whose laptop turns dark at sunset
 * expects KUI to turn with it, and one who explicitly chose light expects light at midnight. A
 * toggle cannot express the difference between "light" and "light because everything else is", and
 * the difference is the whole point. The accessible name says the mode in words — "Theme: follows
 * system" — because the glyph alone cannot distinguish "currently light" from "auto, and it is
 * daytime". `SCREENS-V4.md` §7.4 asks whether the glyph should instead name the theme it will move
 * *to*; it cannot, because a cycle of three has no single target, and that is the half of the
 * finding settled here. The other half — a two-segment control over a three-valued preference — is
 * settled in `AppearancePopover`.
 *
 * ## The appearance popover is this component's own
 *
 * The notifications panel's openness belongs to the caller, because what opening it *means* is a
 * product decision with a real trade-off (does it mark everything read?) and because its contents
 * are fetched and can fail. Neither is true here: the popover reads and writes three browser
 * preferences, has no request behind it and no consequence beyond itself, so a caller that had to
 * hold a boolean for it would be holding it for nothing. It closes on Escape and on a click
 * outside, and `onOpenAppearance` still fires for a caller that wants to know.
 *
 * ## The bell counts, and says so
 *
 * A dot with no number is a colour-only signal. The count goes in the accessible name
 * ("Notifications, 3 unread"), and when there is nothing unread there is no dot at all rather than a
 * grey one — a permanently present marker is a marker nobody looks at.
 *
 * With an alerts feed behind it the figure is the *open count* and the read marker is the badge's
 * tone; both arrive as props and neither is computed here. The band holds no store and folds no
 * feed, which is what keeps the bell and the alerts card reading one number: the store is the
 * kernel's, the card is in a feature package, and a component that recounted either would be the
 * second answer to a question that has one.
