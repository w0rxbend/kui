/**
 * The alerts card (`SCREENS-V4.md` §3.8): a bell, an open pill, and one row per event.
 *
 * ## Two layouts, one component
 *
 * §3.8 draws the same rows twice — one third of the row on the Overview tab, full width on the
 * Alerts screen with the age pushed to the far edge. That is a width and a `--wide` modifier, not a
 * second component: two components drawing one feed is two places for the sentence under an empty
 * feed to drift apart, and this product has just spent a wave repairing exactly that on the metrics
 * cards.
 *
 * ## Every state this card has, and the one that draws nothing
 *
 * `not-configured` renders **no element at all** — not an empty card, not a heading. ADR-032's rule
 * is that a deployment which has not configured a thing is not a deployment with a broken thing, and
 * an empty card headed "Alerts & events" on a deployment running no alerts service sends an operator
 * hunting for an outage that does not exist. Every other state draws the card and says what it
 * knows: the failure with its code and a retry, the refusal with no retry (there is nothing to try
 * again), and the answered-and-empty feed with a sentence naming the source.
 *
 * ## The count in the header is the service's, and never this component's arithmetic
 *
 * `props.state`'s `openCount` is the alerts service's figure over the whole feed; `events` is one
 * page of it, and the filter above the list removes rows from the page. Counting the rows would draw
 * a smaller number in the most reassuring direction, and it would be wrong on every cluster with
 * more open events than fit a page. That is this packet's owned rule; `feedTest`'s
 * "the open count on the card is the API's own figure" is the case that fails when it is broken.
