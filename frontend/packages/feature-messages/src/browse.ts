/**
 * Everything one browse asks for, and the URL grammar it is written in.
 *
 * No DOM, no reactivity, no `fetch`. Every rule below is a function a test can call, which is the
 * only reason the grammar is testable at all: a browse URL is the one thing on this screen that is
 * wrong silently — the server answers 400, or worse answers 200 for a range nobody asked for, and
 * nothing on either side notices.
 *
 * ## Ported from behaviour, not from code
 *
 * This is the TypeScript of `frontend/ui-messages/.../browse/BrowseQuery.scala`. The Scala version
 * could read the parameter *names* out of `kui.message.contract.BrowseAddress`, because that module
 * cross-compiled to Scala.js and both halves saw one copy of the strings. This package cannot: the
 * server's contract module does not compile to TypeScript, and the OpenAPI document the rest of
 * `@kui/api` is generated from describes the stream endpoint's *path* but not its query grammar (a
 * repeated `seekTo` whose values are a two-colon mini-language is not something a generated client
 * can express). So the names and the value grammar are spelled once here, in `BROWSE_PARAM` and
 * `encodeSeek`, and nowhere else in the frontend.
 *
 * That is a real risk and it is written down rather than hidden: renaming `seekTo` on the server
 * would leave this compiling and 404 — sorry, 400 — at run time. The mitigation is that there is
 * exactly one copy, it is named, and `browse.test.ts` asserts the exact query strings the server's
 * own `BrowseParamsSuite` asserts. If the seam ever earns a stronger check, the check is a
 * generated constants file like `constants.generated.ts`, not a second copy of these strings in a
 * component.
 */

/**
 * Where a browse starts.
 *
 * Four shapes, because those are the four ways a person says where to look, plus a fifth
 * (`atOffsets`) that no control produces and that must nonetheless survive: it is how a colleague
 * hands over *exactly* where they were, one offset per partition, and it is the shape the server's
 * own continuation cursors have internally. A control for it would be a table of sixty inputs; a
 * link carrying one is free.

 * maintained separately would drift the moment one gained an entry, and the drift would be

 *
 * ## Why "Automatic" is the empty string and the default
 *
 * The service already resolves a serde per topic and per half of the record, says which it used on
 * every record it returns, and is right for almost every topic. Sending no name at all is what
 * makes the produce form agree with the browse by default: the record is written with the serde it
 * would have been read with. The picker exists for the topic where that choice is wrong — a key
