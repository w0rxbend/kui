/**
 * The row above the record list: where to start, which partitions, what text, and whether to follow.
 *
 * ## This bar is built once and never rebuilt
 *
 * A drawer must not rebuild while somebody is typing in it — a defect this project shipped, where
 * the filter box lost its caret every time results arrived. In Solid 2 the rule is concrete: the
 * bar is **not** inside a `<Show>` or `<Loading>` whose condition flips when records land, and the
 * record list is **not** a sibling that shares a keyed parent with it. Fine-grained reactivity
 * gives you that for free *if* the form stays outside the boundary that re-renders; putting it
 * inside is how the defect returns. `MessagesTab` keeps that arrangement and `messages.test.tsx`
 * asserts it by holding on to the input element and checking it is the same node after a record
 * arrives.
 *
 * ## Nothing here starts a browse
 *
 * Every control reports upwards and the screen decides. That is not indirection for its own sake:
 * changing *where* to read has to stop whatever is running (a browse in flight is reading a
 * different range from the one the controls now describe, and letting it keep delivering would mix
 * two ranges in one list with nothing on screen to say why), and that decision belongs to the thing
 * that owns the session.
 *
 * ## The bar wraps; it never scrolls sideways
 *
 * A control that has slid off the right edge of a bar is a control nobody finds.
 *
 * ## Three rows, and what divides them
 *
 * `SCREENS-V4.md` §3.12 draws three, and the division is by *who applies the control*, which is why
 * it is worth keeping rather than being a layout accident:
 *
 *   1. **Where to read.** Every control here is a parameter the browse endpoint accepts — the seek,
 *      the partitions, the plain substring, the tail.
 *   2. **What to keep.** The typed key and value predicates and the upper bounds have no query
 *      parameter at all; they compile to one CEL expression the message service evaluates per
 *      record (`predicates.ts`). The screen registers it before it starts a browse.
 *   3. **Presets.** A name this browser has given to a row-2 arrangement. Absent when there are
 *      none, rather than an empty row with a heading — §3.12 says so explicitly.

 * When the cluster has no filter engine the button stays and is disabled with the server's reason.
 * Removing it would teach the operator KUI cannot filter, when in fact this cluster cannot.
