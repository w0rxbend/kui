/**
 * The rendering rules this feature shipped with nothing holding them, closed by mutation.
 *
 * ## How each case below was arrived at, and how to check it
 *
 * Every one names a single edit to a file in `src/`. The edit was applied to the source, the whole
 * of `pnpm -C frontend test packages/feature-clusters packages/feature-schemas` was run, **162 of
 * 162 stayed green**, and the edit was then reverted and the case below written. Re-apply the edit
 * named in a case's comment and that case — and, in the ones that say so, only that case — goes
 * red. That is the measurement this file exists to make repeatable; nothing here is a claim about
 * code that was not run in both directions.
 *
 * ## Why they are all in `.tsx` files
 *
 * Because that is where the survivors are. Twelve of twelve rules in `model.ts` are gated and the
 * rules that decide what a component *draws* were not, which is the same split the previous
 * adversarial pass over this package found and the reason it was swept a second time. A pure
 * function gets a test because calling it is one line; a branch inside JSX needs a mount, a flush
 * and a query, and the rule quietly goes unasserted while the file's header argues for it at
 * length.
 *
 * ## One production repair, in `BrokerList.tsx`
 *
 * The first case is not only a missing test. `totalLeaders` was a `reduce`, `reduce` over an empty
 * list is `0`, and the tile drew a bare `0` for a cluster that named no broker — while the chip
 * written to say `no broker answered` could not run at all, because it is read only when the memo
 * answers `undefined` and only a broker carrying a null count could make it so. The memo now
 * refuses an empty list, which makes the figure honest and the chip reachable in the same edit.
