/**
 * The form behind "add a cluster", "change one" and "remove one", and the rules it enforces.
 *
 * ## What this form deliberately cannot do
 *
 * It cannot supply a truststore or a keystore. Those are configuration-file only, and that is a real
 * gap named here rather than papered over: a textarea for a base64 keystore is not a usable way to
 * give KUI a certificate, and the file upload that would be is a piece of work in its own right.
 * `SSL` and `SASL_SSL` against a cluster whose certificate the JVM's default trust store already
 * accepts — which is every managed service — work from this form today.
 *
 * ## Every reason, not the first one
 *
 * Somebody who got three fields wrong should be told about all three rather than discovering them
 * one save at a time. The server accumulates for the same reason (ADR-013) and refuses the same
 * things; these checks exist to answer *before* a round trip and are deliberately a subset — the
 * form never claims something is valid that the server then rejects.
