/**
 * The dialog, and the confirmation that every destructive action in this product opens.
 *
 * ## A dialog interrupts to ask a question
 *
 * That is the whole of its purpose, and it is why a dialog is small, centred, and has exactly one
 * question in it. Anything that is a *place to work* — composing a message, editing a config — is
 * a drawer instead (see `Drawer.tsx`). The two share all of their behaviour and none of their
 * shape.
 *
 * ## Absent from the document while closed
 *
 * Not hidden: absent. A `display: none` dialog is still in the accessibility tree in some
 * combinations, its inputs are still form-submittable, its `autofocus` still fires, and its
 * content is still found by the browser's find-in-page. `<Show>` around the whole surface means
 * "closed" and "not there" are the same fact, which also gives the focus trap a clean lifecycle:
 * it is installed when the surface mounts and torn down when it unmounts, and there is no third
 * state where it exists but should not be running.
 *
 * ## The confirmation, and what it must say
 *
 * A confirmation that says "Are you sure?" is a keystroke, not a decision — people learn the
 * shape of it and clear it without reading. So `ConfirmDialog` requires two things a generic
 * "are you sure" cannot have:
 *
 *   1. **It names the object.** `Purge orders.payments.v2?`, never `Purge this topic?`.
 *   2. **It states the consequence in measurements, not adjectives.** *"This deletes 1,536
 *      partitions' worth of records — about 128 GB. It cannot be undone."* is a sentence an
 *      operator can check against what they believe they are looking at. *"This is permanent and
 *      cannot be undone"* is true of every dialog they have ever dismissed.
 *
 * And for the worst of them — deleting a topic, emptying a topic — it requires the operator to
 * type the object's name. That is not friction for its own sake: it is the one mechanism that
 * makes it impossible to destroy the *wrong* topic by muscle memory, because the muscle memory
 * does not know the name.
 *
 * ## Focus starts on Cancel
 *
 * Every destructive confirmation opens with focus on the safe action. The keystroke that opened
 * the dialog is often still going — an `Enter` held a fraction too long on the row behind — and
 * the confirm button must not be under it.
 *
 * ## Failure keeps the dialog open
 *
 * If the mutation fails, the dialog stays, the typed name stays, and the error appears above the
 * actions with its code. Closing on failure means the operator has to reconstruct what they were
 * doing in order to find out that it did not happen.
