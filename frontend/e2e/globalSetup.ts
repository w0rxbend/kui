/**
 * Waits until the cluster service has finished its first scrape of every registered cluster.
 *
 * ## The failure this exists for, and why "up" was not the right question
 *
 * The three checks above establish that the stack is *listening*. They say nothing about whether it
 * has *asked Kafka anything yet*, and those are different states that a suite cannot tell apart
 * from a screen. Wave 9 lost `brokers.spec.ts:157` on a stack ninety seconds old: that case branches
 * on whether the deployment reports a disk capacity, `/log-dirs` answered an empty list, the case
 * took the "no capacity" arm and then spent fifteen seconds waiting for a sentence the warm product
 * does not draw. A perfectly healthy stack, a correct product, and a red case.
 *
 * ## What is actually polled, measured rather than guessed
 *
 * Measured on the quickstart on 2026-09-11, restarting `kui-quickstart-kui` and asking every two
 * seconds. The three column headings are shortened to fit, and the whole paths are written out here
 * because until wave 11 they were not and the shortened ones do not exist: readiness is
 * `${API}/api/v1/health/ready` — plain `/health/ready` answers **404** on the quickstart — and the
 * other two are `${API}/api/v1/clusters/{id}/brokers` and `.../log-dirs`, which is what the poll
 * below actually asks for. A reader copying a heading into `curl` got a 404 and no way to tell it
 * from the outage this table is about. (Filed by W11-03, whose `smoke.sh` asks the real one.)
 *
 * | t     | ready           | `/brokers`               | `/log-dirs`              |
 * | ----- | --------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
 * | 0–2s  | connection refused | —                     | —                        |
 * | 4–31s | 200             | `ok`, **1 broker**       | `ok`, **0 directories**  |
 * | 33s   | 200             | `ok`, 1 broker, new `fetchedAt` | `ok`, **1 directory**, `totalBytes` 203 GB |
 *
 * So readiness is true twenty-nine seconds before the first scrape lands, `/brokers` is `ok` with a
 * broker in it for that whole window, and the one thing that changes at the moment of the scrape is
 * that `/log-dirs` stops being empty. `brokers.fetchedAt` moves on the same tick — thirty seconds
 * after the first, which is the scrape interval.
 *
 * `status === "ok"` with an **empty** list is therefore the state to wait out, and it is worth
 * saying why that is honest rather than a workaround: an empty list is a true answer. The service
 * really has no log directories to report, because it has not asked for any yet. It is not an
 * error and it should not be reported as one — which is exactly why nothing in the product could
 * have caught this, and why it belongs to the harness.
 *
 * Both sections are polled, and not only the one that moves. `/brokers` costs nothing here and a
 * deployment where it is the slow one would otherwise trade this failure for the same failure on a
 * different case.
 *
 * ## Why it can time out rather than wait for ever
 *
 * A deployment that genuinely reports no log directories — an old broker that does not send the
 * filesystem size, a cluster the service cannot reach — never satisfies this, and a harness that
 * waited for ever would turn that into a hang with no message. Two minutes is four times the
 * thirty-three seconds measured, and the message says which cluster and which section was still
 * empty so that a reader can tell "slow" from "will never happen".
