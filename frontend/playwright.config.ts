/**
 * The end-to-end suite: a real browser, against the product as it is deployed.
 *
 * ## Why this replaced a Scala suite rather than repairing it
 *
 * There was a Playwright suite in `e2e/`, written in Scala, and it went red when the Laminar
 * frontend was deleted. Repairing it looked cheaper than it was:
 *
 * - Almost none of the browser half survived. Twelve of its twenty-six selectors named `data-testid`
 *   attributes the deleted components carried, including the one every test waited on first.
 * - The larger job — the fixtures — was identical in either language, because the shape changed
 *   underneath both: the interface and the API are no longer one server, so a suite has to point a
 *   browser at one origin and assert against another. In TypeScript that is `baseURL` and a few
 *   lines here; in the Scala suite it was several hundred hand-rolled lines.
 * - And it would have put Node and pnpm back into the Mill build, which the split was for. The
 *   suite needs the interface built; if Mill runs the suite, Mill needs the interface.
 *
 * So the browser suite lives with the thing it drives. Mill still owns the *backend's* integration
 * tests — the compose fault-isolation script is not a browser test and stays where it is.
 *
 * ## It drives a running stack rather than starting one
 *
 * `webServer` can start a process; it cannot sensibly start a Kafka cluster, seed it, wait for a
 * schema registry and build two images. `deployment/quickstart/quickstart.sh` does all of that and
 * is the same command a person runs, so the suite checks the stack is up and says how to start it
 * if not. A suite that silently started its own stack would also be a suite that passed against a
 * deployment nobody else can reproduce.
