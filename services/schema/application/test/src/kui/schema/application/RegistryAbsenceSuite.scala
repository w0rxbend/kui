/** The three-way answer every read in this service gives, and the fact the whole service is shaped around.
  *
  * "There is no such cluster", "this cluster has no registry" and "the registry did not answer" are three
  * different things. Collapsing any pair of them produces a screen that lies:
  *
  *   - unknown as not-configured hides a broken link behind a feature that looks switched off;
  *   - not-configured as unreachable puts a permanently red panel on a deployment where nothing is wrong;
  *   - unreachable as an empty list claims the registry holds nothing, which sends an operator looking for a
  *     schema somebody deleted instead of at a registry that is down.
