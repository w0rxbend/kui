/** Would the registry accept this schema for this subject?

  * A read that carries a body, and deliberately not a mutation: nothing is registered, nothing is stored, and
  * running it twice does the same thing as running it once. It refuses nothing on a read-only cluster either
  * — "may I look at whether this would work" is exactly the question a read-only KUI should still answer, and
  * refusing it would push an operator to try the change on the registry directly, which is the opposite of
  * what read-only mode is for.
  *
  * The check runs inside the registry (see [[SchemaRegistryPort.checkCompatibility]]). KUI does not implement
  * Avro, JSON-Schema or Protobuf compatibility rules and must not: the verdict that matters is the one the
  * registry will give when the schema is actually registered, and a second implementation would eventually
  * disagree with it in the direction that loses data.

  * signed rather than a constant this file chose.
  *
  * The `before` value in the audit record is the level that was in force when the change was made, read for
  * that purpose. It costs one extra request and it is what turns the record from "somebody set BACKWARD" into
  * "somebody replaced FULL_TRANSITIVE with BACKWARD", which is the sentence an incident review needs. When it
  * cannot be read the record says so rather than omitting the field, because a blank `before` and an unknown
  * `before` mean different things.
