/** The four things a screen reads out of a registry, each as its own use case.
  *
  * Every one of them goes through [[RegistryQuery.on]], which is where "unknown cluster", "cluster with no
  * registry" and "registry that did not answer" are turned into their three different answers. No use case
  * here contains an `if` about any of that, which is the point: the decision is made once and cannot drift
  * between the subject list and the schema panel.
  *
  * ==None of these caches anything==
  *
  * A registry's answers change when somebody registers a schema, and the person most likely to be looking at
  * this screen is the person who just did. A stale subject list would show them their own change missing,
  * which reads as a failure of the registration rather than of the cache. The read path is therefore a
  * request per call, bounded by the upstream's own timeout and circuit breaker — the registry is protected
  * from KUI by the bulkhead, not by hiding its state behind a snapshot.

  * The registry hands back every subject name in a single response and offers no search, sort or paging of

  * fine at the sizes registries actually reach — a few thousand names is a few hundred kilobytes — and it is
  * the only option the API offers, but it is why this call has the shortest timeout budget of the four and
  * why the page size is bounded like every other list in KUI.
  *
  * ==The page is cut before anything is enriched==
  *
  * A subject's format, version count and compatibility level cost a call each, and the page is what bounds
  * how many are made: twenty-five rows on screen is twenty-five [[SchemaRegistryPort.summary]] calls, no
  * matter whether the registry holds six subjects or six thousand. Enriching the whole list and then cutting
  * a page out of it would turn opening a list into two thousand calls to a component that is a single-writer
  * JVM, which is the failure this ordering exists to prevent — and it is why the fold happens here rather
  * than in [[SubjectCatalog]], which is pure and has no calls to make.
  *
  * ==Enrichment never fails the page==
  *
  * The subject list is one call, and it either arrived or it did not; that failure travels, because an empty
  * subject list is a claim the registry holds nothing. Everything after it is a secondary call about one row,
  * and a row that loses its facts keeps its name. A subject that disappeared from a list because the call
  * that decorated it did not answer would send an operator looking for a schema nobody deleted.
