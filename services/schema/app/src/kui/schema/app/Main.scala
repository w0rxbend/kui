/** The schema service process.
  *
  * `IO` appears here and nowhere else in the service (ADR-010). The startup sequence is [[ServiceMain]]'s,
  * shared with every other service process; what is left here is the part that is about schemas.
  *
  * ==It starts even when nothing is configured==
  *
  * A deployment where no cluster has a `schemaRegistry` block starts this process, serves its routes, and
  * reports every cluster as `not_configured`. It does **not** refuse to start, and that is deliberate: this
  * service is optional, and a process that exited because an optional feature was unused would restart-loop
  * in every deployment that simply does not use a Schema Registry — turning "you have no registry" into a
  * crashing container.
  *
  * ==The address policy==
  *
  * Registry URLs are checked against the same `UrlPolicy` every other upstream address is, read from
  * `KUI_ALLOW_PRIVATE_UPSTREAMS` exactly as `ServiceMain` reads it for the configuration loader. A Schema
  * Registry is the upstream most likely to live at `http://schema-registry:8081` inside a Compose network,
  * and a policy that refused that address here — after the loader had accepted it — would be a service that
  * cannot reach the registry it just logged at startup.
