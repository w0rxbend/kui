/** Writing this service's OpenAPI document to a file, and checking that the committed one is current.
  *
  * The document is generated from the same endpoint values the server is built from, so it cannot describe a
  * path the service does not serve. It is *committed* rather than only generated because the gateway merges
  * every service's document into one (ADR-003), and a merge that had to build eleven services first would be
  * a merge nobody could run.
  *
  * A committed generated file is only trustworthy if something fails when it goes stale, which is what
  * `--check` is for: `./mill services.consumer.api.openApiCheck` fails when the file on disk no longer
  * matches the endpoints, and CI runs it.
