/** Application types to wire types, and nothing else (ADR-033).

  * Nothing here computes. Every number on the wire — a total lag, an excluded-partition count, a delta —
  * was computed once in `services/consumer/domain`, where the anomaly rules live, and is copied across. A
  * mapping that re-derived a total would be a second rule that can disagree with the first, which is the
  * defect `LagMath` exists to make impossible.
  *
  * The two `GroupSortField` enums meet here, and only here. They are two enums on purpose: one is the wire
  * vocabulary in `libs/contracts-core` (build rule A14), the other is the application's own, and rule A3
  * forbids the application module the import that would let them be one type.
