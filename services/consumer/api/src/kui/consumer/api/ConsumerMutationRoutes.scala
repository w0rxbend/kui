/** The four routes that change a cluster, and the one that only says what a change would do.
  *
  * ==The destructive request is the second one (ADR-045)==
  *
  * `planReset` reads live offsets, resolves what the operator asked for against them, and answers with the
  * exact numbers that would be written plus a signed token. `applyReset` takes only that token. There is no
  * route in this file that accepts a specification and writes offsets in one hop, and that is the whole point
  * of the pair: a form submission carries what the operator typed, not what the cluster will do, and only the
  * server can compute the second.
  *
  * ==Read-only and audit (ADR-047)==
  *
  * Neither refusal nor recording is implemented here. `MutationGuard` in the application layer owns both, and
  * every write goes through it: it resolves the cluster's profile, refuses a read-only cluster with
  * `KUI-READ-ONLY` **without touching a Kafka client**, records the attempt either way, and invalidates the
  * snapshot on success. This module contributes nothing to that decision, which is why there is no read-only
  * check written out below — one written here would be a second copy of the rule, and the copy that can
  * disagree.
  *
  * `planReset` refuses on a read-only cluster too, and it is deliberately not a mutation. A wizard that
  * happily renders a plan the operator is not allowed to apply teaches them that the refusal at the end is a
  * bug; the honest moment to say "not on this cluster" is before they compose the change.
  *
  * ==The CSRF header==
  *
  * Every endpoint here carries it and none of them checks it. `KuiEndpoint.mutation` declares the header, so
  * a request without one fails to decode and never reaches this file; binding its *value* to a session is
  * M6's job, because there is no session in M4 to bind it to. Requiring the header from the day the endpoint
  * exists is what stops it from being a breaking change for every client that already shipped.
