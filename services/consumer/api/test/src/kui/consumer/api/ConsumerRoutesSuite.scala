/** The order the router tries this service's routes in, asserted through the router rather than by reading
  * the list.
  *
  * ==Why this suite exists==
  *
  * `GET /clusters/{c}/consumer-groups/lag` and `GET /clusters/{c}/consumer-groups/{groupId}` match the same
  * URL. Whichever is registered first claims it. That would be an ordinary routing footnote except for one
  * property of Kafka: describing a group that does not exist does not fail. `Admin.describeConsumerGroups`
  * answers with a *fabricated* group in state `DEAD`, and the detail route is deliberately built to pass that
  * through, because a stale bookmark should land on an empty page rather than an error.
  *
  * Put those two together and the wrong order produces the worst kind of defect: a well-formed `200`, a body
  * that decodes, no error anywhere, and a lag column on the consumers screen that silently stops updating
  * because every poll is answered with the detail of a group called "lag". Nothing in the layers below can
  * see it — the use cases are both correct, and each one's own suite passes.
  *
  * So the assertion is not "the list is in this order". It is: the lag URL reaches the lag use case, and the
  * detail use case is never asked about a group named `lag`.
