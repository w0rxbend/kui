/** This service's three mutations, out of the shared vocabulary.

  * `kui.security.audit.MutationKind` is the whole of KUI's classification, across every service, and these
  * are the three cases that belong to consumer groups. There used to be a second enum here with the same
  * three names and the same three operation strings; E2 in `docs/BACKLOG.md` removed it, because two enums
  * spelling one classification is how an audit trail comes to have two vocabularies.
  *
  * The list is still declared, because the contract suite's "enumerate every endpoint and assert each one is
  * classified" test reads it.

    *      exists to have noticed;
    *   3. run the operation;
    *   4. record the outcome — always, including on failure and on cancellation;
