  * The new `openCount` travels with the event so that the pill and the bell move on the response the caller
  * already has. A browser that re-derived the count by removing one row from the page it was holding would be
  * counting a page, which is the mistake this wave has a rule about.

/** The two things a caller can do to this service.
  *
  * ==Why the feed is not `Section`-shaped here==
  *
  * Rule A3 keeps the wire out of this layer, so a `Section` cannot appear in a signature. What crosses is an
  * [[AlertFeed]] with the per-rule [[kui.alerts.domain.RuleReport]]s inside it, and `AlertsMapping` turns
  * each report into its own `Section` — which is what "`Section`-wrapped per rule" means and why one dead
  * rule costs one row rather than the document (ADR-053 §7).
  *
  * ==`Left` is only ever a wrong request==
  *
  * A cluster KUI has never heard of is a 404, because the caller followed a link to something that does not
  * exist. Everything else answers 200 with a feed that says what it knows, exactly as the metrics service
  * does: the alerts card sits on a dashboard beside cards that work, and a 4xx would make a feed behaving
  * correctly indistinguishable from a broken one.
