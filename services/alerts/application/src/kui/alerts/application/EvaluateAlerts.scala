/** One evaluation pass, for one cluster.
  *
  * It is a use case rather than a method on the loop so that "what one pass does" can be asserted without a
  * fibre, a clock or a `Resource` anywhere near it — the loop is then only responsible for the cadence, and
  * `AlertEvaluationLoopSuite` only has to assert the cadence.
  *
  * The pass reads the facts once, folds them with the rules over the events already open, and hands the whole
  * decision to the store in one call. Nothing between the read and the write consults a clock a second time:
  * one pass is one instant, so an event's `openedAt` and the `lastSeenAt` of the events beside it agree.
