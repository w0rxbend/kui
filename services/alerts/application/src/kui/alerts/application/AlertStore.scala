/** One cluster's feed, as one read answers it.
  *
  * ==Why the counts are fields rather than something the caller derives==
  *
  * `openCount` is the number in the danger pill (`SCREENS-V4.md` §3.8) and `unreadCount` is the bell's dot
  * (§3.9). Both are counted **over the whole store**, not over `events`, which is a page. A browser that
  * derived either from the rows it received would show `2 open` on a feed whose second page holds a third,
  * and wave 6's own rule says an alert count recomputed from a page is not the open count.
  *
  * @param events
  *   at most the requested page size, newest first, resolved rows included. The design's card draws five rows
  *   of which two are resolved, so a feed that returned only open events could not draw it.
  * @param openByRule
  *   how many of the open events each rule opened, over the whole store for the same reason `openCount` is.
  *   It is what lets a rule's own row say `2 open` beside the section that says the rule ran, so that a
  *   reader can tell "this rule found two things" from "this rule could not look".
  * @param lastReadAt
  *   when this principal last asked to be marked up to date, if ever. `None` means they never have, which is
  *   why every event is unread for them — not a bug, and not a reason to invent a marker at first sight.
  * @param evaluatedAt
  *   when the rules last ran for this cluster. `None` before the first pass, and the feed renders that as
  *   "KUI has not evaluated this cluster yet" rather than as a clean bill of health.

/** Where events live between passes.
  *
  * ==Why this service has a store at all==
  *
  * Every other read in KUI is a snapshot of a cluster as it is now, and `libs/cache`'s `SnapshotCell` is the
  * right shape for that. An alert is not: "a log directory crossed 80% an hour ago and is still above it" is
  * a fact with a beginning, and a cell that holds the current answer can only ever say that it is above the
  * threshold *now*. The age in every row of `M01` is the thing a snapshot cannot produce.
  *
  * ==What it is not==
  *
  * It is not durable. A restart loses the open events and the read markers, and the next pass re-opens
  * whatever is still true with a new `openedAt` — so an age is an age since KUI last started, at worst. That
  * is stated in ADR-053 rather than hidden: making it durable means a Kafka topic and a replay, which is
  * `libs/config`'s metadata store and a milestone of its own.
