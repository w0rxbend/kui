/** One fibre per configured cluster, running the rules on a cadence and filing what they decided.
  *
  * ==Why a loop and not an evaluation per request==
  *
  * An alert has an age, and an age needs somebody to have been watching. Evaluating on the request path would
  * make "opened four hours ago" mean "opened when you last opened this tab", would make every repaint of the
  * dashboard four admin calls, and would mean that a cluster nobody is looking at is a cluster with no alerts
  * — which is precisely the cluster an operator most needs the bell to light up for.
  *
  * ==What a failed pass does, and does not do==
  *
  * A pass cannot fail: `ClusterFactsPort` answers a `FactReading` for every fact and raises for none, so a
  * refused admin call becomes a rule that did not run and a row that says so. What is caught here is the
  * thing that should be impossible — an adapter that raised instead of answering — and it is logged as an
  * error and dropped, because a fibre that exited on one would leave a cluster silently unevaluated for as
  * long as the process ran, with nothing on any screen saying so.
  *
  * The pass also does **not** close events when the facts are unreadable. That rule is the domain's and is
  * tested there; it is named here because it is the property that makes this loop safe to run against a
  * cluster whose admin calls are being refused.
  *
  * ==Why the first pass is immediate==
  *
  * A process that slept for its interval first would answer every request in its first `evaluationInterval`
  * with a feed that has never been evaluated, and the operator watching a fresh deployment is the one most
  * likely to be looking.
