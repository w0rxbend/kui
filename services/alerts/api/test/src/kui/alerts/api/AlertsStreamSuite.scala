/** What one subscriber sees on the change stream.
  *
  * ==Why this is a suite rather than a line in a route suite==
  *
  * The frames are what stop the card's pill and the bell's dot disagreeing, and two properties of them are
  * decided in `AlertsRoutes.changes` and nowhere else: **which** cluster's changes reach a subscriber, and
  * **what** a frame carries. Neither is visible to `AlertsRoutesSuite`, which drives the JSON routes through
  * a stub backend that has no streaming capability at all.
  *
  * Both were ungated when this service was first written, and both were found by mutation: replacing the
  * filter's equality with a prefix match left every one of the service's 133 cases green, and a subscriber
  * watching `prod-eu` would then have been woken by every change on `prod-eu-2`.
