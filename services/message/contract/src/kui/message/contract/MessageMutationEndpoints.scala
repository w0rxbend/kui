/** The two calls that write to a topic: publishing a record, and copying a range of records into another one.
  *
  * ==Why they are here and the browse endpoint is not==
  *
  * `MessageEndpoints`, next door, is JVM-only: its response is an event stream, which needs `fs2` and a
  * server-side stream body, and neither links for the browser. These two are ordinary request/response calls
  * with JSON on both sides, so they live in the cross-compiled half — which means the browser's produce form
  * and the gateway's proxy route are both derived from the same value the service serves, rather than from
  * three people's separate ideas of the path. That divergence is the defect this project has shipped before.
  *
  * ==The marker (ADR-047)==
  *
  * Both carry `KuiEndpoint.MutationKey`, so the per-cluster read-only refusal and M5's enumeration have
  * something to key on that is not a naming convention, and both carry the CSRF header from the day they
  * exist rather than from the day there is a session to bind it to — a header added later has to be added to
  * every client that already shipped.
  *
  * ==Why there is no plan token here (ADR-045)==
  *
  * ADR-045 requires a plan for a destructive operation, and asks a specific question: *what exactly will this
  * do to what is already there?* Publishing and resending have no answer to that question, because they take
  * nothing away. They append. An operator can see the whole of what a produce will do by reading the form
  * they filled in, and the whole of what a resend will do from the range and the destination — and the server
  * answers both with what actually landed, offset by offset, which is a receipt rather than an offer.
  *
  * A purge is the operation on this service that *is* destructive, and it is the one that will carry a plan.
