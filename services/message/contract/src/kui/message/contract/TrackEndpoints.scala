/** What a finished track found (ET-001).
  *
  * ==Why `scanned` is on the answer==
  *
  * Because a track that matched nothing and a track that read nothing are the same screen without it, and
  * they mean opposite things: the first says the value is not in those topics in that window, and the second
  * says the window was empty. A support engineer acts differently on each.
  *
  * ==Why `truncated` is its own field and not an inference==
  *
  * A caller cannot tell "exactly `limit` hits exist" from "the scan stopped at `limit`" by counting, and the
  * difference is whether they have the whole answer. Inferring it from `hits.size == limit` would be wrong in
  * exactly the case that matters.
  *
  * @param hits
  *   the matching records with the topic each came from, in the order they were read: topic by topic, and
  *   within a topic in time order. The screen sorts them by timestamp, which is what a person means by "in
  *   order", and it can only do that because every hit carries its own timestamp

/** Following one business event across several topics (ET-001, ADR-029).
  *
  * ==Why a POST, when it reads nothing and changes nothing==
  *
  * Because the request is a document. A track names a list of topics, a match with three fields and a closed
  * window; expressed as query parameters that is a URL nobody can read and several clients would encode
  * differently. It carries no mutation marker and no CSRF header, because it changes nothing — what it is, is
  * a search whose question does not fit in a query string.
  *
  * ==Why it answers all at once==
  *
  * The scan is bounded by its window, its topic list and its hit cap, so the answer has a size the service
  * decided in advance. The streamed variant — results as they are found, for a scan long enough that waiting
  * is unpleasant — is ET-002, and it wants the same second stream relay in the gateway that the browse has;
  * it is not built yet, and this endpoint is not a substitute for it on a wide window.
