/** `POST /internal/v1/clusters/{clusterId}/messages/track` (ET-001).
  *
  * ==Where the validation lives==
  *
  * In two places, deliberately, and they check different things. The DTO's own codec refuses a document that
  * is malformed *as a request* — a source that is not one of three words, a header search with no header name
  * — and answers with a decoding failure naming the field. `TrackQuery.of` refuses a request that is
  * well-formed and not a legal scan: an unordered window, one wider than the deployment allows, a pattern
  * that will not compile. Neither could do the other's job: the codec has no configuration and the domain
  * never sees a `Json`.
  *
  * ==Why the stream is collected here==
  *
  * The use case is a stream because a scan produces its hits over time and one of them may be the last thing
  * that happens before a budget runs out. This endpoint answers all at once, so it folds that stream into the
  * counts and the hits the caller asked for — the terminal `Finished` event carries the numbers, so nothing
  * is counted twice. The streamed variant (ET-002) binds the same use case to an event stream and needs a
  * relay in the gateway; it is not built.
