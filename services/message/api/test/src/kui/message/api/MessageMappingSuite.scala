/** The field-level rules `MessageMapping` argues for at length, and which nothing asserted.
  *
  * `services/message/api` shipped one suite — `ServiceRbacGuardSuite` — so every rule in this file was
  * reachable only through a route that asserts a status code, which is not what a route suite looks at.
  * Five mutations were applied one at a time against `./mill services.message.__.test`, each leaving it at
  * 183/183 green: making `payload`'s absent branch unreachable, dropping `deserializeErrors` to `Nil`,
  * zeroing `filterErrors`, removing the floor under a spent budget, and mapping `NoTimestamp` to
  * `LOG_APPEND_TIME`.
  *
  * The budget and filter cases read the encoder's own output — the frame `MessageMapping.event` builds —
  * rather than a hand-written literal, because a hand-written literal on each side of a wire is what put
  * two of the metrics service's four cards on screen drawing nothing.
