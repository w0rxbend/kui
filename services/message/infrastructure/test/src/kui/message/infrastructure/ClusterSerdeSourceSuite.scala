/** Which sentence a record's marker carries when a decode did not go the way the operator configured.
  *
  * `ClusterSerdeSource` shipped with no suite: it is reachable only through a browse, and a browse suite
  * asserts records rather than markers. Two mutations were applied one at a time against
  * `./mill services.message.__.test`, each leaving it at 204/204 green — reversing the precedence of the
  * skipped-serde note over the fallback's own complaint, and dropping the `requested.isDefined` guard that
  * keeps the note off a decode the caller explicitly asked for. Both are about one sentence on one row, and
  * that sentence is the only thing that tells an operator whether to go and look at their registry or at
  * their data.
  *
  * The serdes here are built through `ClusterSerdes.resource` from a factory that fails the way a
  * schema-registry serde fails when the registry is down, so the arrangement is the product's own rather than
  * a hand-written stand-in for it.
