/** A cluster's resolved connection settings, for another KUI service.
  *
  * ==Why this document carries credentials==
  *
  * It is served only on `/internal/v1`, only to a caller carrying a signed principal (ADR-020), and it is the
  * mechanism ADR-036 names for exactly this purpose: non-owner services "keep receiving the resolved
  * `ClusterProfile` over the internal contract", and "keystore bytes travel inside the signed inter-service
  * channel". ADR-046 is the decision, taken at M2's first consumer, and it closes `ARCHITECTURE.md` §14's
  * open question.
  *
  * The alternative, considered and rejected, was for every Kafka-facing service to become a metadata-store
  * client holding `kui.store.encryptionKey`. That would put the one key whose loss makes every stored secret
  * unrecoverable into four processes instead of one, and would give write-capable credentials for
  * `__kui_config` to three services that must never write it.
  *
  * Every credential inside `security` and `properties` is a `Secret`, so `toString`, log interpolation and
  * span attributes render `***`. The only encoder in KUI that can write one out is `ClusterConnectionCodecs`,
  * which this document uses and nothing on `/api/v1` does; `kui.cluster.api.SecretLeakSuite` asserts that as
  * a fact about every declared endpoint rather than as a convention.
  *
  * ==What is deliberately absent==
  *
  * Keystore *bytes* stored in `__kui_files` are not here yet. ADR-036 says they travel on this channel and
  * they will, but nothing in M2 configures such a keystore, and shipping a field no producer ever fills is
  * the permanently-`null` field CLAPI-001 already ruled against. `StoreSource.Inline` exists in the shape
  * above, so the field arrives with its first producer and not before.
  *
  * @param version
  *   the store version this profile was resolved at; it is also the `ETag`. A consumer compares it rather
  *   than diffing the document, so an unchanged profile costs one 304. It is on the body **as well as** in
  *   the header because the header is an HTTP concern that an in-process client (the all-in-one build) does
  *   not have, and the consumer's rebuild decision must work identically in both deployment shapes
  * @param updatedAt
  *   when the cluster service resolved it, for a consumer's own staleness reporting
