/** Turns "the metadata store changed" into "this cluster is now at this version".
  *
  * A cluster registered or edited on one replica has to become visible on every replica without a restart,
  * and the version that the other services subscribe to has to go up so that their Kafka clients are rebuilt
  * (ADR-036). This component is the piece of that which sits between the store and the registry.
  *
  * ==Why it is idempotent rather than filtered==
  *
  * The store's change feed carries this process's *own* writes back to it. That is not a nuisance to filter
  * out — it is the read-your-writes mechanism (ADR-042 §3) and the reason a write can be confirmed at all. So
  * the listener is idempotent instead: a cluster whose id and version it already holds is a no-op, with no
  * reconcile, no version bump and no event.
  *
  * Suppressing self-writes by writer identity instead would break the multi-replica case, which is the case
  * the whole design exists for. Replica B's write looks exactly like a foreign write to replica A and exactly
  * like a self-write to replica B, and only one of those two may be ignored.
  *
  * ==Why versions only ever go up==
  *
  * A store reconnect replays records this process has already seen. If a version could go backwards, every
  * downstream service's version comparison would be wrong in the silent direction: they would conclude
  * nothing had changed and keep talking to the old brokers with the old credentials. The recorded version for
  * a cluster is therefore the larger of what is held and what arrived.
