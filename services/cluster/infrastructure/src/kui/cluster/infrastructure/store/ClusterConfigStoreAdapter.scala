/** The cluster context's view of the metadata store: profiles under `cluster/<id>`, and nothing else.
  *
  * The generic store speaks keys and versioned JSON envelopes. This adapter is the only place in KUI that
  * knows a cluster profile is what one of them contains, and it is deliberately narrow: it owns the
  * `cluster/` prefix, so a bug here cannot corrupt the settings, role or masking sections. That is ADR-036's
  * single-writer-per-section rule, enforced by nobody writing outside their own prefix.
  *
  * ==One malformed record is not an outage==
  *
  * `list` skips a record it cannot decode, logs it once with the key and the reason, and returns the other
  * nine clusters. A startup that dies on one bad row is an outage caused by a typo, and the operator who made
  * the typo is then locked out of the screen that would let them fix it.
