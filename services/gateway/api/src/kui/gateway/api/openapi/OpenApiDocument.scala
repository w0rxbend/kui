/** Writes `docs/api/openapi.json` and `docs/api/openapi.browser.json`, and fails the build when either
  * committed copy has gone stale.
  *
  * A generated document that nobody regenerates is worse than none: an integrator reads it, believes it, and
  * builds against an API that changed three releases ago. `--check` is what makes the committed file
  * trustworthy, and it runs in CI on every change (PLAN §46).
  *
  * The document is generated for the **full** product -- every service KUI has a contract for -- and not for
  * whatever a particular deployment happens to have configured. The committed file describes the API, which
  * is a property of the release; a deployment that has not enabled a service still ships the same
  * documentation.
  *
  * Two files, one merge. The second is the *edge view* of the first -- the same endpoints with every header
  * the gateway strips from browsers removed -- and it is what the browser's TypeScript client is generated
  * from. [[BrowserProjection]] explains why the browser cannot use the first.
