  * This is the enumeration the declaration exists for. The gateway is the one module that can see every
  * service's published contract at once, so it is the only place the question "is anything unprotected?" can
  * be asked in full — and asked at build time, which is the difference between a rule and a hope.
  *
  * An endpoint added without a declaration fails here. It would also be refused at runtime, deliberately, but
  * a build failure names the endpoint and arrives before anyone deploys it.
