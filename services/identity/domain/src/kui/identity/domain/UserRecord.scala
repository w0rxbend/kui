  * @param hash
  *   the stored password. Never a password, and never printable: see [[PasswordHash]].
  * @param groups
  *   the groups this account is in, which is what a role's subjects match against. They are *not* roles: a
  *   role is a property of the deployment's policy and a group is a property of the person, and keeping them
  *   apart is what lets one role file describe a form deployment and an OIDC one.
  * @param mustChangePassword
  *   whether this person has to set a new password before they get a session at all. Enforced, not
  *   advertised: [[LoginOutcome.PasswordChangeRequired]] is what a login against such an account produces,
  *   and there is no path from it to an authenticated principal that does not go through a completed change.
