/** The only way this service changes a cluster (ADR-047).
  *
  * M5 ships KUI's first *topic* mutations — create, configure, add partitions, delete — into a product that
  * has no authentication and no global read-only mode. ADR-047 says they may not ship bare, and names the
  * three things that arrive with them. All three are here:
  *
  *   1. the per-cluster `readOnly` refusal — `KUI-READ-ONLY`, decided **before any Kafka client is touched**,
  *      which on this path means before the admin pool is asked for a client, before a `NewTopic` is built
  *      and before a single byte reaches a broker;
  *   2. the audit record — exactly one per attempt, successful or not, through `AuditSink[F]`;
  *   3. the [[kui.topic.domain.TopicMutation]] marker, which is a parameter of [[guard]] rather than a
  *      convention, so a mutation added without a classification does not compile.
  *
  * The message and consumer services carry the same guard over the same port, and the three are deliberately
  * separate objects rather than one shared one: rule A11 forbids either service seeing another's application
  * layer, and the thing that must not drift — the record, the outcome vocabulary and the port — is declared
  * once in `libs/security-core`, which is where all three read it from.
  *
  * ==Why a successful mutation invalidates the snapshot==
  *
  * The topic list is served from a per-cluster snapshot refreshed on a timer. Without this, an operator who
  * creates a topic is sent back to a list that will not contain it for up to a minute, and the obvious
  * conclusion — that the create silently failed — is wrong and unfalsifiable from the screen. So a successful
  * mutation asks for a re-scrape. It is a request, not a wait: the refresh runs on its own fiber and the
  * response does not depend on it, because a create that blocked on a scrape of a ten-thousand-topic cluster
  * would take the scrape's latency for a fact the operator already knows.

trait MutationGuard[F[_]] {

  /** Wraps one mutation. The order is fixed and tested:
    *
    *   1. resolve the cluster's profile — a cluster this deployment does not have is `KUI-CLUSTER-NOT-FOUND`
    *      and is recorded, because an attempt to change a cluster that is not there is worth having noticed;
    *   1. if the profile says read-only, refuse and record the refusal, without running `op` at all;
    *   1. run `op`;
    *   1. record the outcome — always, including on failure and on cancellation;
    *   1. on success, ask for the cluster's topics to be re-scraped.
    *
    * @param principal
    *   who is doing this, as the gateway signed it and this service verified it. It is a parameter of the
    *   call rather than of [[MutationGuard.make]] because it is a property of the request in flight, and a
    *   guard built once at start-up cannot know it. Until authentication exists every request arrives as
    *   `Principal.Anonymous`, which is an honest record of a deployment with no login.
    * @param resource
    *   what was operated on, in the shape an operator recognises: `orders.v1`.
    * @param detail
    *   short strings worth recording — the partition count a topic was created with, the settings that were
    *   changed. **Never a credential**: an audit log is routinely more widely readable than the thing it
    *   describes.
