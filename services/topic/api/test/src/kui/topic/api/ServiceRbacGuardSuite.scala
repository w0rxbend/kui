/** The service refusing on its own account.
  *
  * ==Why this suite exists at all==
  *
  * The gateway already checks permissions, and it does so on the same declaration this service reads, so it
  * is fair to ask what a second check buys. The answer is the case this suite constructs: a request that
  * never went through the gateway. A KUI service listens on its own port and verifies a signed principal;
  * anything on the same network that can reach the port and hold a signing key can call it. If the only check
  * lived at the edge, the topic service would be open to whatever else runs beside it.
  *
  * So every request below goes straight to the service's own routes, with a valid principal and no gateway
  * anywhere, which is exactly the shape of the attack the second check exists for.
