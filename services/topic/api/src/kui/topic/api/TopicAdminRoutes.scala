/** The six routes that administer a topic: create it, configure it, grow it, delete it — and the two that
  * only say what growing and deleting would do.
  *
  * ==The destructive request is always the second one (ADR-045)==
  *
  * There is no route in this file that takes a partition count and grows a topic in one hop, and none that
  * takes a topic name and deletes it. The two destructive routes accept a plan token and nothing else, so the
  * change that happens is the change the operator was shown. Create and configure are single calls because
  * their effect *is* their request, which is the test ADR-045 §4 sets rather than a judgement about how
  * frightening each one feels.
  *
  * ==Read-only and audit (ADR-047)==
  *
  * Neither refusal nor recording is implemented here. `MutationGuard` in the application layer owns both, and
  * every write goes through it: it resolves the cluster's profile, refuses a read-only cluster with
  * `KUI-READ-ONLY` **without touching a Kafka client**, records the attempt either way, and asks for the
  * topic snapshot to be re-scraped on success. This module contributes nothing to that decision, which is why
  * there is no read-only check written out below — one written here would be a second copy of the rule, and
  * the copy that can disagree.
  *
  * ==The CSRF header==
  *
  * Every endpoint here carries it and none of them checks it. `KuiEndpoint.mutation` declares the header, so
  * a request without one fails to decode and never reaches this file; binding its *value* to a session is
  * M6's job, because there is no session yet to bind it to.
