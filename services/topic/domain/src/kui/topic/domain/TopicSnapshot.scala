/** Every topic of one cluster, at one instant, with the index the list searches.
  *
  * ==Why the index is part of the value==
  *
  * A search index built per request over ten thousand names would be rebuilt for every keystroke of every
  * user. Built here, it is built once per scrape and thrown away with the snapshot it belongs to, which is
  * the whole of ADR-038's "in memory first" position. Making it a field rather than something the list
  * pipeline constructs also removes the way that design goes wrong: an index built from a different list from
  * the rows would make search quietly return topics the list cannot show, or hide topics it can. The
  * constructor is private and [[TopicSnapshot.of]] builds both halves from one input, so they cannot drift.
  *
  * @param incomplete
  *   topics the scrape listed and could not describe, with the reason, so the list can say "9 998 of 10 000
  *   topics; 2 could not be read" instead of quietly showing fewer. It is disjoint from `topics`: the adapter
  *   keys it by `listings.keySet.diff(described.keySet)`, so a topic here has no row at all, which is exactly
  *   why it needs naming. [[TopicSnapshot.names]] and `TopicStatistics.topicCount` both rest on that
  *   disjointness — they concatenate the two halves rather than merging them, and a topic counted twice would
  *   inflate the cluster total the topics screen prints above its table.
