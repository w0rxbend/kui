/** Everything `kui-topic-service` does that changes a Kafka cluster (M5).
  *
  * `TopicEndpoints` next door serves the reads and states plainly that nothing in it mutates. This is the
  * other file, and it arrives with the safety net rather than before it, which is the ordering
  * `docs/ROADMAP.md` §3 exists to enforce and which ADR-047 turned into a rule.
  *
  * ==Every endpoint here carries the marker and the CSRF header (ADR-047)==
  *
  * `KuiEndpoint.mutation` attaches both. The marker is machine-readable, so M5's read-only enumeration is a
  * policy over an existing classification rather than a hunt through paths, and `TopicAdminEndpointsSuite`
  * asserts that every endpoint in [[all]] carries one. The CSRF header is required from the day the endpoint
  * exists, even though there is no session yet to bind it to, because a header added later has to be added to
  * every client that already shipped.
  *
  * ==Two of the four are two calls, and which two is not a matter of taste (ADR-045)==
  *
  * ADR-045 §4: an operation needs a plan phase when its effect is not a function of its request alone.
  *
  *   - [[create]] and [[updateConfig]] are single calls. The partitions, the replication factor and the
  *     settings are the numbers the operator typed, and the server answers with what it did.
  *   - [[planPartitions]]/[[increasePartitions]] is two, because the effect depends on how many partitions
  *     the topic has *now* and because raising the count rewrites key-to-partition routing for every record
  *     produced afterwards. ADR-045 names this operation explicitly.
  *   - [[planDeletion]]/[[deleteTopic]] is two, because two things the request cannot say decide what
  *     deleting means here: how many records are about to be lost, and whether the cluster's
  *     `auto.create.topics.enable` will recreate the topic seconds later under the broker's defaults. KUI's
  *     own message browser has already been bitten by the second, so this product does not get to treat it as
  *     a footnote.
  *
  * The apply calls take a token and nothing else. A `curl` user cannot skip the preview either, which is
  * ADR-045's stated consequence and the reason the protection lives in the contract rather than in a screen.
