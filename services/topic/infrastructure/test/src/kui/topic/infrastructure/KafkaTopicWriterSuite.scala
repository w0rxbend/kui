/** How a refused write is told apart from an unreachable cluster, and what KUI is allowed to say about it.
  *
  * `KafkaTopicWriter` shipped with no suite of its own: every rule in `writeError` was reachable only
  * through a route that asserts a status code. Three mutations were applied one at a time against
  * `./mill services.topic.__.test`, each leaving it at 298/298 green — making the
  * `UnsupportedVersionException` arm unreachable, appending the exception's own message to a refusal, and
  * turning a configuration `DELETE` into a `SET`. The first two are closed here; the third needs an admin
  * client this module has no stub for and is reported rather than pretended.
