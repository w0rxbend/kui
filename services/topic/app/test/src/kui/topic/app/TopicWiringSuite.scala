/** The plan-signing key, and the line an operator needs when it was not configured.
  *
  * `services/topic/app` declared a test module in `build.mill` and shipped no test source, so both halves
  * of `signingKey` were ungated. The fallback's consequence is invisible until a second replica exists — a
  * plan minted by one process is refused by the other, and the operator sees a confirmation that will not
  * confirm — which is exactly why the file says it is "logged loudly rather than being silent", and why
  * that sentence needs a case rather than a comment.
