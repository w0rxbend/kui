/** Everything `kui-connect-service` serves, and the one place a typed failure becomes an HTTP response.
  *
  * It is the alerts service's `api` module with the stream removed and three writes in place of one,
  * deliberately: the five things an `api` module does are the same in every service, and a second shape for
  * them would be a second place for authentication, error mapping and the OpenAPI document to drift.
  *
  *   - it binds the endpoints `services/connect/contract` publishes to the use cases in
  *     `services/connect/application`, with no path written out here (ADR-003);
  *   - it verifies the gateway's signed principal before any use case runs (ADR-020), and checks the
  *     permission the endpoint declares before the use case is even called (ADR-021);
  *   - it maps a `KuiError` to the one error envelope and the one status (ADR-034);
  *   - it maps application types to contract types ([[ConnectMapping]], ADR-033);
  *   - it starts nothing. `services/connect/app` is the only module in this service allowed to.
