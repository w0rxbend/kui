/** The only way a mutation happens in this service (ADR-047).
  *
  * ==It is the consumer service's guard, through the alerts service's copy of it==
  *
  * Four services implement this classification and they used to disagree about one case, which is the case
  * this service copies deliberately: a **cancelled** mutation is `MutationOutcome.Unknown`. `AuditSink`'s own
  * words for why — "Kafka gives no guarantee that it was not applied, so a record claiming either would be a
  * lie" — were written about a Kafka write, and they survive the move to an HTTP call to a Connect worker
  * unchanged, in fact more strongly: a cancellation lands between the request going out and the `202` coming
  * back, and the worker has very often already accepted it. A record saying `Failed` would tell an incident
  * review that a connector was never restarted when it may well have been. The topic and message services
  * wrote `Failed` here and W6-A1 repaired both; this is not a third.
  *
  * ==The order, and it is asserted rather than described==
  *
  *   1. resolve the cluster's profile;
  *   1. if it is read-only, refuse with `KUI-READ-ONLY` **without calling the worker**, and record the
  *      refusal — an attempt to change a read-only cluster is exactly what an audit trail exists to notice;
  *   1. run the operation;
  *   1. record the outcome — always, including on failure and on cancellation.
  *
  * There is no step 5. The consumer service's guard invalidates a snapshot at the end; this service holds no
  * snapshot at all, because every fact it reports is read from a worker at the moment it is asked.
  *
  * ==On refusing a pause on a read-only cluster==
  *
  * Pausing a connector writes nothing to Kafka, so this refusal is stricter than the operation strictly
  * needs. It is the answer `Action.ConnectOperate` already encodes — `isAlter = true` decides the audit
  * question and the read-only question with one field — and a read-only cluster whose sinks can still be
  * stopped by anyone with a browser is not read-only in any sense an operator means. ADR-054 §3 argues it;
  * `RbacLawsSuite` asserts the vocabulary half and this guard is the half that runs.
