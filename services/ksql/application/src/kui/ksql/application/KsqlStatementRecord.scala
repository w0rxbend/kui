/** One statement, attempted or run.
  *
  * ==Why this is not a `MutationRecord`==
  *
  * ADR-047 §3 requires one audit record per mutation and `kui.security.audit.MutationRecord` is that record.
  * Its `kind` is a `MutationKind`, a sealed enum in `libs/security-core` with twelve cases and none for a
  * ksqlDB statement. Wave 8's partition gives `libs/security-core` to an adversarial packet, not to this one,
  * so this packet cannot add the thirteenth, and ADR-051 §5 already settled what a service does in that
  * position: it does not invent a second vocabulary locally, and it does not reuse the nearest case, because
  * either produces an audit trail whose answer to "what changed today" depends on which service did it.
  *
  * What it does instead is `ConnectorOperationRecord`'s answer, one service over, which is itself
  * `AcknowledgementRecord`'s: a **second record type** that shares the vocabulary rather than forking it.
  * This record shares `MutationOutcome`, so "how it ended" is one enum across the whole trail; it renders its
  * principal through `AuditPrincipal`, so "who" has one spelling; and the sink that writes it writes
  * `LoggingAuditSink`'s own field names, imported from that object rather than retyped.
  *
  * The line that would remove this type is asserted rather than described: `MutationKindGapSuite` fails the
  * day `MutationKind` grows a case whose operation starts with `ksql.`, which is the day this record
  * collapses into `MutationRecord` and this file is deleted.
  *
  * ==What the record carries, and what it deliberately does not==
  *
  * It carries the **statement**, in full, because that is the only thing an incident review can act on: "a
  * ksqlDB statement was run on production" names nothing, and the statement names the stream, the table and
  * the topic. It does not carry the rows a query returned — an audit trail is a record of what was done, not
  * a copy of the data, and a pull query's result in a log line is a copy of somebody's records in a place
  * nobody expects to find them.
