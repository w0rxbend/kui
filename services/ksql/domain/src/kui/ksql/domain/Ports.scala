/** One ksqlDB cluster, as this service needs to speak to it for anything that finishes.
  *
  * The port is per *ksqlDB cluster*, of which a Kafka cluster has at most one — `KsqlSettings` is singular
  * where `ConnectClusterSettings` is a list, because a second ksqlDB cluster over the same brokers shares the
  * same command topic and is the same logical service. So there is no aggregation layer above this one and no
  * per-worker section on the wire; what varies is whether the one server answered.
  *
  * ==The push query is not here==
  *
  * A push query never finishes, so its port is `kui.ksql.application.KsqlQueryStream` and is declared a layer
  * up. That is not a taste: an unbounded answer is an `fs2.Stream`, rule A1 keeps fs2 out of a domain module,
  * and `services/message` splits its browse the same way for the same reason. What is here is everything
  * whose answer is a value.
  *
  * ==Nothing here throws==
  *
  * Every method answers a `KuiError` on the left. A server that is down, slow, starting up or rejecting KUI's
  * credentials arrives as a value, because the caller has to keep the rest of the product working while this
  * one upstream is broken.
