/** One structured log line per ksqlDB statement, in the same trail every other mutation writes to.
  *
  * ==The field names are imported, not retyped==
  *
  * `LoggingAuditSink.Field` is the vocabulary of KUI's audit trail — `audit.operation`, `audit.cluster`,
  * `audit.resource`, `audit.principal`, `audit.principal_kind`, `audit.outcome` — and this sink writes those
  * exact keys by referring to that object rather than by spelling the strings again. That is the whole
  * defence against the drift ADR-051 §5 refuses to create: a ksqlDB statement is a second record *type*, and
  * a second record type that wrote `ksql.who` instead of `audit.principal` would be a second audit trail,
  * which is the thing nobody can query.
  *
  * ==The statement is a detail field, and it is the point of the line==
  *
  * `audit.detail.statement` carries the whole statement. "A ksqlDB statement was run on production" names
  * nothing an incident review can follow; the statement names the stream, the table and — for the one
  * statement in ksqlDB's language that destroys records — the topic. `audit.detail.destructive` carries
  * whether it was that one, so the trail can be filtered to the statements that deleted something without
  * re-parsing every line's SQL.
  *
  * `audit.before` and `audit.after` are absent, and their absence is a fact rather than an omission. The two
  * fields hold a scalar the operation moved, and a ksqlDB statement moves no scalar: a `CREATE STREAM`
  * creates an object, and writing a stream's name into a field a reader diffs would put a value there that
  * cannot be compared to anything.
  *
  * ==It never fails the operation it is recording==
  *
  * Every failure inside it is caught and dropped, for `LoggingAuditSink`'s stated reason: a sink that could
  * refuse would one day stop an operator creating a stream because a log disk was full.
